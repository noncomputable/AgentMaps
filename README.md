# AgentMaps

Make agent-based simulations on maps! Give it some neighborhood's OpenStreetMap data, and it'll generate buildings and give you utilities to embed and give rules to agents into the neighborhood.

After including and loading Leaflet, include this script to use Agentmaps: https://unpkg.com/agentmaps@1/dist/agentmaps.js.

Demos and code dist are in the gh-pages branch.
